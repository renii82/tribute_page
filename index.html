          Biography
        </h2> 
        <p class="text">
          (1961-1997)
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Princess Diana became Lady Diana Spencer after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975. She married the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, on July 29, 1981. They had two sons and later divorced in 1996. Diana died on August 31, 1997, from injuries she sustained in a car crash in Paris. She is remembered as the "People's Princess" because of her widespread popularity and global humanitarian efforts. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Diana was born on July 1, 1961, near Sandringham, England. Her parents divorced when Diana was young, and her father won custody of the children. Diana had two older sisters, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and a younger brother, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Following her initial education at home, Diana attended Riddlesworth Hall School and then West Heath School. Although she was known for her shyness while growing up, she showed an interest in music and dancing. She became Lady Diana Spencer after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Diana had a great fondness for children. After attending finishing school at Institut Alpin Videmanette in Switzerland, she moved to London. She began working with children, eventually becoming an assistant at Young England Kindergarten.

          Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales, when she married Charles on July 29, 1981. They had two sons together: Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, born on June 21, 1982, and Prince Henry Charles Albert David — known widely as "Prince Harry" — born on September 15, 1984. Diana’s separation from Charles was announced in December 1992 by British Prime Minister John Major, who read a statement from the royal family to the House of Commons. Their divorce was finalized in August 1996. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Following her divorce, Diana devoted herself to her sons and charitable efforts, including raising awareness about the dangers of leftover landmines in war-torn Angola. She maintained a high level of popularity with the public. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In the early hours of 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in hospital after being injured in a car crash in a road tunnel in Paris.

         She passionately fought for the ban of landmines
        </h4> 
        <p class="text">
 Just a few months before she died in a car crash, Princess Diana travelled to Angola, and an enduring picture of her stepping out on to an active minefield remains in our minds and hearts. She advocated ardently for the ban of landmines and one more iconic image of her sitting alongside a young girl with an amputated leg also came out of the visit. This visit and the bold images became a turning point for the world to put the spotlight on Angola and its landmines. What’s heartening is that her younger son, Prince Harry, has taken on the mantle by continuing his mother’s work.

          She worked ardently for HIV/AIDS awareness
        </h4>
        <p class="text">
          When the world woke up to the horrors of HIV/AIDS in the early 80s, patients were shunned and stigmatised because the disease had a sexual connotation. Princess Diana was not one to shy away from battling for HIV/AIDS awareness as well. As early as 1987, we got to see her compassionate side when she visited AIDS patients at a hospital in London. She was also seen shaking a patient’s hand without wearing gloves, sending a message to the world that the disease could not be transmitted by touch. This single act by a Princess largely changed people’s perceptions towards HIV/AIDS.

          She helped the young and homeless
        </h4>
        <p class="text">
Diana was an advocate of Centrepoint, a charity that helped young and homeless people off the streets, by becoming its patron in 1992. Her work at the charity involved helping youth between the ages of 16-25 find shelter, food and a job. She also took her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, to the charity’s shelters. In 2005, William became the patron of Centrepoint. He even slept rough in 2009 on the streets of London telling the Telegraph at the time: “My mother introduced that sort of area to me a long time ago. It was a real eye-opener and I am very glad she did. It has been something I have held close to me for a long time.”
<br><br>         
The charity says they helped 125,000 homeless young people since the late 60s, with 88% of all young people coming through Centrepoint moving on “positively.” The charity’s youth homeless databank found that in 2015 around 150,000 young people in Britain approached their local authority for housing help, but a third would be sent away without support. The research suggests that the true scale of the problem has been more than five times greater than the number suggested by the Government statutory homelessness figure.        </p>
